== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q) How does the Global Display features work? =

A) The two globals (Website & Admin Area) override all other display features. There is no reason to define a Post ID, etc if Font Awesome will always load on the website frontend.

= Q) What is needed to define the shortcode? =

A) The [myfa] shortcode takes 2 attributes.

** name="" ** Is required to change the icon, and should includle the fa- prefix: [myfa name="fa-home"]

[Font Awesome Icons](http://fontawesome.io/icons/)

** class="" ** Allows you to use other Font Awesome features, such as size, rotation, fixed with, etc. [myfa name="fa-home" class="fa-2x fa-rotate-90"]
